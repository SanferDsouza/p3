# Practice Password Phrases

This is **p3** - practice password phrases.
I often mistype passwords, or forget them, so it's a good idea to practice them.
The overarching idea is to store the passwords checksums in a file along with a prompt of sorts.
A password hint is a good prompt.
The program would provide the prompt, the user would enter the password in a no-echo terminal,
and then the program would verify if user got the password correct.
